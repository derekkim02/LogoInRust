# LogoInRust

This is my first project in Rust, an interpreter for the Logo programming language.

## Project Description

Logo is an educational programming language, designed in 1967 by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert, and Cynthia Solomon. This project is an interpreter for Logo, written in Rust.

So far, I have implemented turtle control, variables, ifs, whiles, math and comparisons.
I currently don't have support for proceedures, nor do I plan to add it in the near foreseeable future as this is just a little project for me to 
get familar with rust.
